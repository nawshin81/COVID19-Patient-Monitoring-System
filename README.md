### Portable Health Monitoring System for COVID-19 Patient ###

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2
virus. Doctors and medical staff must stay distant from the patient because of safety
issues. Many traditional health monitoring devices are regularly used in hospitals, but
they are mostly expensive, non-portable, and used for patients with severe conditions.
During this pandemic, the doctors and medical staffs are not enough on the count, and
they struggle to care for all the patients.

So, our work approaches a simplified device that can be wearable as a wrist band and
monitor the significant body parameters for COVID-19 patients, such as body
temperature, heart rate, and saturated oxygen level. Based on these parameters, we
can send signals to doctors and medics as well as communicate with patients if
necessary.
The project has two parts.
- A portable device for patientsâ€™ bodies and
- A central monitoring device at the nurse station.
